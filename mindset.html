    <div class="text1"><p>Mindset is the most important part of the personality and that is a place where the difference is made between people. The best mindsets are created in terrible situations, for example, poverty, loss of a close member of the family, huge disappointment etc. Point is that we cannot have healthy and righteous mindsets if we haven't passed some bad situations in life. A famous quote will best describe this: "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger" and I will add "and makes you better". In the previous 4 years, I have changed my personality a lot. Credits go to my family, best friend Marko and to the books. Believe it or not books had a huge impact on my personality, especially book written by Mark Manson named "Subtle art of not giving a fuck". Lessons that I learned from that book and life are:</p><ul><li>  Always give your best to improve your personality</li><li>Don't give a fuck about stupid things, only for important things such as family   </li><li>   Listen to the advice that important people are saying</li><li>  Honesty is the most important part of every relationship   </li><li> <u>*Don't do things to someone else that you don't want others to do to you *  </u></li><li>  Don't try to be someone else, just be the best version of yourself  </li><li>One little decision can have a huge impact on your life ("the Butterfly effect")</li><li>It is normal to be hated by people if you are more successfull in every aspect of life</li><li>Don't let emotions control your behavior, always listen to your mind and be patient when deciding</li></ul></div>
